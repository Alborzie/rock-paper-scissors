Hello, 
I am Alborz Borzoo . I am a 13 year old student and I am learning python in the Tehran Institue Of Technology, located in Iran, Gilan province, Rasht city.
This is my first ever project on github . It is a rock,paper,scissors game with GUI that is made using the tkinter module . the program is made so that the player 
can choose between the three options and a random option chooser , and the computers choice will allways be randomised .
I mainly built this project for my own fun and to test my self , and it worked out ok .
